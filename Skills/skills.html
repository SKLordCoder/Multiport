                  I know Python well and use it for various things like making
                  websites, working with data, and creating useful tools. I'm
                  good at building parts of websites using frameworks like
                  Django and Flask, which help make websites faster. I
                  understand how to organize my code using classes and objects,
                  which makes it easier to change and fix things later. I can
                  work with data, like tables of numbers, using tools that help
                  me understand and analyze the information. I'm able to make
                  charts and graphs from data to show others what I've found in
                  an easy-to-understand way. I know how to connect my programs
                  with other services and get information from them, making my
                  work more powerful. While I'm not an expert, I can do some
                  simple machine learning tasks to make predictions based on
                  data patterns. I always try to write neat and clear code, and
                  I'm eager to keep learning and growing my Python skills.

                  I use HTML to create web pages, like building blocks that
                  structure content on the internet. I'm familiar with tags that
                  define headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists. I know
                  how to make links that take people to other pages or websites
                  when clicked. I can add images to my web pages to make them
                  visually appealing and engaging. I understand how to create
                  forms with text boxes, checkboxes, and buttons for user input.
                  I'm able to embed videos and audio clips in my web pages to
                  share multimedia content. I know the basics of creating tables
                  to display data in rows and columns. I'm excited to learn more
                  about HTML and how it works together with other technologies
                  to make awesome websites.

                  I use CSS to style and make my web pages look visually

                  I can adjust the layout of my web pages with CSS to create
                  columns and grids. I understand the concept of selectors and
                  classes to target specific elements for styling. I'm eager to

                  I use C++ to build programs for various purposes, like
                  applications and games. I understand how to create functions
                  that perform specific tasks, making my code organized. I can
                  work with variables to store and manipulate data, like numbers
                  and text. I'm familiar with using if statements and loops to
                  control how my program behaves. I know how to create classes
                  and objects, which help me organize and reuse code. I can
                  handle user input and display output, making my programs
                  interactive. I'm aware of pointers and memory management,
                  which allow me to control how my program uses resources. I'm
                  excited to explore more advanced topics in C++ and continue
                  improving my programming skills.

                  I use JavaScript to make websites come to life, adding
                  interactive features and dynamic content. I understand how to
                  respond to user actions, like clicking buttons or filling
                  forms, using JavaScript. I can manipulate the contents of a
                  web page by adding, changing, or removing elements. I'm
                  familiar with variables, which help store and manage data in
                  my programs. I know how to create functions that perform
                  specific tasks, making my code neat and organized. I can work
                  with if statements and loops to make my code do different
                  things based on conditions. I'm learning about APIs to connect
                  my website with other services and get more functionality. I'm
                  excited to keep learning JavaScript to make even more
                  impressive and interactive web projects.
